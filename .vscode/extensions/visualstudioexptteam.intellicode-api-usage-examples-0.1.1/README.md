Ever wish you could easily access code examples for APIs you work with? IntelliCode API Usage Examples makes that a reality. Now with just one click you can access examples for over 100K different APIs!

**Getting Started:**
1. Open any supported file and hover your mouse **over** any existing or new call (must have open and close parentheses).
2. If IntelliCode knows that API call, you will see a window appear below where you are hovering.
3. **Scroll** inside the appearing window until you see &#9733; **Top API Usages for** and **click** the **See Real World Examples From GitHub** link.
4. A results view will appear displaying code examples grouped by how common the API usage is. The API usage will be highlighted in blue.
